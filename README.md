GitHooks with Hapi
---

The goal of haphazard hooks is to implement a hapi server that can be opened up via nginx and set up with Basic Auth to be able to set up GitHooks quickly using [child_process](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html) to be able to quickly receive githooks specifically from GitHub and deploy them to your apps quickly and easily!
